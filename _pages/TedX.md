I've had the wonderful opportunity to share my early journey through several TedX events, including TedXManipal and TedXRamjasCollege. On this page, I have carefully curated and added the videos of these inspiring talks for you to enjoy. I hope they not only entertain you but also ignite a spark of inspiration within you.

By participating in these TedX events, I was able to connect with diverse audiences and share my unique experiences, insights, and ideas. It was a platform where I had the privilege of sharing my journey, discussing topics close to my heart, and exploring new perspectives.

I believe that watching these talks can be a source of motivation and empowerment for individuals from all walks of life. Each video encapsulates a different aspect of my journey, providing glimpses into the challenges I faced, the lessons I learned, and the growth I experienced along the way.

I invite you to take a moment to dive into these captivating videos. Join me on this immersive journey as I unravel my thoughts, ideas, and stories, all aimed at inspiring and empowering others.

## TedX RamjasCollege

I vividly remember the exhilaration and nerves that coursed through me as I stepped onto the stage to deliver my first TEDx talk. At the tender age of 17, I found myself standing before a sea of eager faces, ready to share my ideas and experiences. The spotlight beamed down, illuminating the immense potential that lay before me, and I knew that this moment would be etched in my memory forever.

As I began to speak, the atmosphere crackled with anticipation. I took a deep breath, allowing the energy of the room to fuel my passion, and I embarked on a journey of words that would captivate and inspire. My talk delved into a subject close to my heart, one that had shaped my worldview and ignited a fire within me – the power of empathy in transforming lives.

Drawing from personal anecdotes and introspection, I painted a vivid picture of the transformative impact empathy can have on individuals and communities alike. I expanded upon the idea that empathy is not merely an emotion or fleeting sentiment, but rather a catalyst for change and understanding. It bridges divides, fosters compassion, and promotes harmony in a world often plagued by indifference and discord.
