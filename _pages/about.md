My name is Sovesh Mohapatra, a PhD student in BioEngineering at [University of Pennsylvania](https://be.seas.upenn.edu/) under [Dr. Hao Huang](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8837947) and [Dr. Minhui Ouyang](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8844108). I completed my bachelors from [University of Massachusetts Amherst](http://umass.edu/) with triple major in Computer Science, Linguistics, and Mathematics in three years. At UMass, I worked with [Dr. Gottfried Schlaug](http://profiles.umassmed.edu/display/22559132) in gearing towards predicting and enhancing a patientâ€™s recovery potential and optimizing rehabilitation techniques for stroke patients. In addition to academics, I served as a council member in the Dean Student Advisory Council (DSAC) and was a Resident Assistant in the Brett-Brooks cluster for over two years.

I've spent some excellent summers working at MIT CSAIL, UMass IALS, and UMass Linguistics via internships. In summer 2022, I worked at UMass Linguistics department with [Prof. Rajesh Bhatt](https://www.umass.edu/linguistics/member/rajesh-bhatt) on automatic discovering of prefix and suffix of verbs in Aryan languages. Along with completing my work with Dr. Gottfried Schlaug on automatic segmention and predicting the extent of chronic lesions in stroke patients. In summer 2021, I worked at [MIT Visualization group](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/) on accessible visualization design using textual and screen reader modalities for people with visual disabilities. Along with that, I interned at [UMass IALS](https://www.umass.edu/ials/csi) as a core summer intern at Dr. Schlaug's lab, working on understanding the effect and spread of stimulation on human brains.

When I'm not working, I am generally [exploring national parks]({ site.url }}/national-parks), playing Valorant, or star gazing. I like to [blog]({{ site.url }}/archive.html) and have written a few articles compiling my experiences with graduate school admissions, computational neuroscience, etc.

Some people in the gaming community (especially in Valorant circle) know me as *Sesh*.
